siamaksamie [11:04 PM] 
Alright, I should have added you all as collaborators. Let me know if you didn't get an invitation

siamaksamie [11:15 PM] 
Also, i misread the requirements for sprint 1 and sent the TA our user stories instead of our vision;

"REMINDER: Please email(or message on moodle) your vision before the
submission of your user stories. By Tuesday night preferably. 1 message/team."

We covered a lot in our meeting but we did not write a structured vision. I wasn't there last week, did he mention how he would like that formatted? We should do that ASAP.

siamaksamie [11:21 PM] 
If anyone wants to take the lead, I uploaded the contents of our first meeting on GitHub labelled Meeting1.txt

dana.alexandra [11:27 PM] 
By vision, did he mean our project?

[11:31]  
After our first meeting, he told us to fix our notes on that meeting and send it to him... that would include a detailed description of what we're planning to do

[11:31]  
And i think Ryan already fixed those notes

siamaksamie [11:46 PM] 
we've created a much more deatailed description before writing the user stories

dana.alexandra [11:47 PM] 
Yeah would that be the vision?

siamaksamie [11:53 PM] 
It's not well formatted. It's more like an overview of our discussion of features.

[11:54]  
Also i have a question, the vision was due tuesday but we have to submit our work tomorrow morning.

[11:54]  
is "our work" the github?

[11:55]  
Seriously, i wasn't there last week so I'm not too sure what he expects in the vision and what work we need to send in tomorrow.

roykhoury [11:57 PM] 
The TA didn't really say anything about that, he only sent in the file without saying anything


----- Yesterday February 2nd, 2017 -----
[12:02]  
I think we're going to upload a contributions.txt on github and everyone can just like add to it when they do something

[12:02]  
Since the TA wants us to keep track of everyone's contributions

dana.alexandra [12:17 AM] 
Dont we just have to send him 6-7 user stories for tomorrow?

[12:17]  
Btw this convo too should be on github ryt

siamaksamie [12:34 AM]

chenjie [7:33 PM] 
Hello, sorry for missing the meeting wednesday

[7:34]  
I went to the career fair and it took longer than expected

[7:35]  
Anyways, I worked on how our website would look like and I'd like some feedback

siamaksamie [7:40 PM] 
Cool cool show us tomorrow

[7:41]  
Or upload now but I think everyone is studying for the quiz haha

chenjie [7:42 PM] 
lol true

[7:44]  
I'm also thinking of writing a script that updates the github slack conversation file every day, but I cant guarantee anything

siamaksamie [7:46 PM] 
That actually sounds cool

roykhoury [8:03 PM] 
Cool cool

[8:03]  
We laid out a little template of our homepage

[8:03]  
In the document


----- Today February 3rd, 2017 -----
siamaksamie [9:35 AM] 
Hey guys, for the specs, I think we should go this route

[9:35]  
Front end

HTML: used to place elements on webpage

CSS: used to style HTML elements

Bootstrap: a CSS library to allow quick, responsive styling.

AngularJs: a JavaScript library to program dynamic elements on screen and to send requests to the backend.

Back end

Laravel: a PHP framework

MySQL: database management system where we will store our site and user's information

roykhoury [9:36 AM] 
Yeah that sounds good man, angularJS and Laravel :+1::+1:  I approve

roykhoury [10:32 AM] 
Btw guys meet us at H854 if you're free right now
