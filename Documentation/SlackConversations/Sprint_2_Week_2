ryan [12:31 PM] 
@mnhn329  I don't see your branch on github yet.  You were having some issues with that when I left yesterday??

chenjie [1:06 PM] 
Huh I thought i fixed his problem

[1:06]  
Im gonna check with him again

[1:06]  
Yea he was having some connection problems with his github yesterday

[1:07]  
So thats why theres a random test commit on master

ryan [1:40 PM] 
Also there are 2 open pull requests that need to be merged before tmrws meeting. They need 2 comments each and then they can be merged right away

dana.alexandra [1:41 PM] 
Did u email the prof yet?

[1:41]  
siamak we need the linkkk

[1:41]  
or roy

ryan [1:43 PM] 
I did not email him yet.

[1:44]  
I can wait until this evening but if there's stuff that's not ready by then we can show him at the meeting with live demo or screenshots

dana.alexandra [1:45 PM] 
Yeah that works

[1:45]  
Maybe just write about how we organized our folders

[1:45]  
And mention that we fixed our user stories

[1:45]  
And we can show the site tomorrow

ryan [1:48 PM] 
@adamrais  and @jng11232   I'm looking at you guys for the comments and then to merge those 2 pull requests. It's just a few clicks, only takes a minute but it should be you guys cuz everything we do on github leaves a trace and the TA will want to see some activity from everyone

[1:48]  
Let us know if ur not sure how

adamrais [1:49 PM] 
Okay so I need the git bash for that?

[1:49]  
Or I can do it in the website

ryan [1:49 PM] 
Just the website

[1:49]  
Find the pull requests tab and there's a comment section

adamrais [1:49 PM] 
Okay doing it now

dana.alexandra [1:50 PM] 
Alsooo slack and contributions are updated??

ryan [1:51 PM] 
The one by Scabandari needs 1 more comment, Adam so leave one and then merge it with the green merge button

ryan [2:14 PM] 
@channel  no the contributions document has not been updated. Can we start a doc or text thing on here that everyone can edit? is that a thing? Also it has to be someone who has not made a pull request yet that uploads it and puts in the pull request

dana.alexandra [2:15 PM] 
Well the file o uploaded kinda has everything

[2:15]  
Well work division

ryan [2:20 PM] 
it's true they're basically the same thing but in the marking scheme aren't they listed as different?

ryan [2:25 PM] 
also maxim create an empty document in Documentation/meetings/meeting2_2_08_17.txt , I'm going to delete it cuz it's the same as the one Dana uploaded but it's empty

roykhoury [3:12 PM] 
I have a working version of the website but the thing is if I send you the link I have to like run it from my computer so u guys can see it otherwise it doesn't work

[3:12]  
prequiz-roykhoury.c9users.io

[3:12]  
Can you guys try it out?

[3:13]  
Actually on mobile it's not greate so on PC if u can haha

ryan [3:15 PM] 
Can confirm it works great on android. I can search for and find Concordia  and I can  create an account. Looks really good !!!

jng11232 [3:16 PM] 
I'm not sure how to do the pull request but ill try later in an hour

roykhoury [3:17 PM] 
Oh cool! Haha awesome

ryan [3:17 PM] 
OK but whatever you do DO NOT merge a pull request until u are 100℅ positive is has 2 comments. @jng11232   we had some probs with that this week. It's a big no no

[3:18]  
Just ask if not sure

jng11232 [3:18 PM] 
Okk

ryan [3:18 PM] 
Yeah Roy looks a beaut.

roykhoury [3:18 PM] 
Try entering "Concordia University" as the institution and

[3:18]  
comp341 for a class

ryan [3:18 PM] 
K one sec

roykhoury [3:19 PM] 
Without the quotes haha ofc

dana.alexandra [3:19 PM] 
Works for me!!!

[3:19]  
Goood job

roykhoury [3:20 PM] 
Oh wait comp 341 with a space

[3:20]

roykhoury [3:22 PM] 
Nono like this!

[3:22]  
And then uhh

[3:23]  
And then u just press the arrow or enter

ryan [3:24 PM] 
oh yes I can confirm that it does take me to a new page on its entered like that!!

[3:24]  
but wait, it takes me to a new page and says 0 entries found

roykhoury [3:24 PM] 
Hmmm yeah it's supposed to find some entries

ryan [3:24 PM] 
hang on, i didn't type it correctly let me try again

roykhoury [3:25 PM] 
Make sure there's no extra spaces I have to work on that

[3:25]  
Oh okay

ryan [3:26 PM] 
Yeah dude it works. the page comes up and says i can take the quizes

roykhoury [3:26 PM] 
Alright awesome!!

[3:27]  
But yeah the problem is u have to type it exactly like that I'm still trying to find a way to make it less strict

jng11232 [4:07 PM] 
so just to be clear, do i just comment ?

ryan [4:48 PM] 
@jng11232   look at the delete meeting pull request and leave a comment. and then we need one more from someone else before we can merge it

ryan [5:00 PM] 
@siamaksamie   did you mention that you emailed the TA in the past or did you contact him through moodle? I'm ready to email him but I don't have an email address

siamaksamie [6:11 PM] 
I sent through moodle

mnhn329 [6:19 PM] 
wait roy did you make a branch under my name?

roykhoury [6:19 PM] 
Nop it wasn't me

[6:19]  
I thought you made a branch

mnhn329 [6:21 PM] 
i tried again

[6:21]  
but then i saw

[6:21]  
"Maxim Updated an hour ago by roykhoury"

[6:21]  
so im confused

[6:22]  
unless my misshap yesterday is causing a problem

roykhoury [6:22 PM] 
I'm not sure actually I was doing stuff on git but I didn't make a branch called Maxim

mnhn329 [6:23 PM] 
ya im not sure either

[6:23]  
but i just wanted to doublecheck with you\

ryan [6:38 PM] 
to anyone who has successfully cloned the project. did you have to upload a public ssh key to the github page?

ryan [6:44 PM] 
i'm having problems cloning

roykhoury [7:31 PM] 
Umm

[7:32]  
U don't need to upload anything an SSH key gets assigned automically like I don't think u need to do anything about it

[7:32]  
Also

[7:32]  
Clone the project from my branch if you're running on c9 because the master branches project is for local hosting with xampp and it's not the same!

ryan [7:36 PM] 
ok thanks. for now I just wanted to clone it so i could resolve the merge conflicts cuz on the pull request Update SlackConvestation.txt #23 its says we need to do that via the command line. If anyone knows how to do that please take a look as right now I'm struggling to clone the project..

roykhoury [7:45 PM] 
Haha yeahhh I've had a conflict before once

[7:45]  
It's a process

[7:45]  
Hmm if you're just cloning it to a folder at home all u need to do is

[7:45]  
git clone url

[7:45]  
So

[7:45]  
git clone https://bla  bla bla

ryan [7:46 PM] 
i know but i'm getting this

[7:46]  
Cloning into 'SOEN341'...
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

[7:46]  
having trouble finding the solution but still working on it. hope is not lost yet

[7:49]  
ah Roy!! I forgot the https: there's a little button that says use https and i didn't notice it. successfully cloned!

[7:49]  
thanks

roykhoury [7:49 PM] 
Ohh hahaha okay awesome it wakes now!

[7:49]  
Works*

ryan [7:50 PM] 
yup. what are the chances of a live demo tmrw? i tempered expectations and said we might have to just show him some screen shots...

roykhoury [7:51 PM] 
Hmmm well I could show him the site I sent u

[7:51]  
It's online!

[7:51]  
I just have to run it from one of the lab computers

[7:51]  
So if it works there it'll work I think it should work there

ryan [7:52 PM] 
oh sweet!

ryan [8:17 PM] 
conflict merge situation resolved

no env files

ryan [10:07 AM] 
when i cloned the project it didn't come with a .env file

[10:07]  
halp!

roykhoury [10:09 AM] 
Yeahhhhh I put a little annotation is ur "view hidden files" checked?

[10:10]  
And LOL roger haha but it worked! That's what counts

roykhoury [10:18 AM] 
If you check "View Hidden files" after having cloned it delete all the files and clone it again

[10:19]  
View hidden files should be in the little settings icon on the top right of the left file explorer tab there

ryan [10:50 AM] 
kk I'll try that

[10:50]  
tnx
