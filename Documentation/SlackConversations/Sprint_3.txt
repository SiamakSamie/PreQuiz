siamaksamie [7:00 AM]

roykhoury [10:23 AM] 
Also why u up so early on a Saturday wth

dana.alexandra [10:24 AM] 
Says the one who is answering

[10:24]  
Hahahah

[10:24]  
Morning guys

[10:24]  
Monday works for me too

jng11232 [10:24 AM] 
Im good for monday

[10:24]  
And morniing

roykhoury [10:28 AM] 
Hahahah

[10:28]  
Monday it is then?

[10:28]  
We'll wait for others

adamrais [12:10 PM] 
Good for Monday !

roykhoury [3:13 PM] 
Hey Adam I'll check out ur profile page soon today although whenever u upload something u should upload It on ur branch not on the master! Haha

adamrais [3:14 PM] 
perfect, im really lost with github tbh, took me time to figure out how to commit

roykhoury [3:15 PM] 
Try it out now if u want

[3:15]  
Your branch is a bit behind try to update the content of your branch

[3:15]  
From the master

adamrais [3:16 PM] 
okay will do, btw i install the C9 stuff but its kinda spooky to undertand everything, like i didnt code from c9 cause i didnt know how to

[3:16]  
it will be good if monday we can have a tuto about how to code on C9

roykhoury [3:21 PM] 
Yeah I did that last time when you had ur midterm,

[3:21]  
Although u have to use c9 and the stuff I did to create the profile page

[3:21]  
We don't use php directly that's why

[3:21]  
I'll check the file though I'll see if we can use it!

adamrais [3:22 PM] 
okay perfect! otherwise ill try to fix this on monday

[3:22]  
but ill make sure the about us page will be code on c9

roykhoury [3:35 PM] 
That's good yeah! I'll let you know

roykhoury [3:52 PM] 
Ok yeah so I checked it out, we can't really use that unfortunately, there's like a bunch of "rules" I guess that has to be followed I'll show you how to do it on Monday!

[3:52]  
You can keep it in ur branch if you want but I think we should remove it from master

adamrais [3:53 PM] 
okay perfect tho!

roykhoury [3:53 PM] 
:+1::+1:


----- February 19th -----
ryan [11:02 AM] 
is it safe to merge the remaining pull request? I'm about to clone our project into a new workspace  in cloud9 and i was hoping to clone master with everything up to date

roykhoury [11:03 AM] 
Yeah go ahead

[11:03]  
It's good

[11:03]  
I've made progress from it

[11:04]  
But it'll require another 2 comments so clone it now u can still make changes and it won't conflict

ryan [11:04 AM] 
Added the menu slider on the side #37

[11:05]  
i only see this open for now and it's got 2 comments. you have another in mind?

roykhoury [11:05 AM] 
Yeah this one is safe to merge

[11:05]  
But that was done friday

[11:05]  
I've made progress since Friday locally

ryan [11:05 AM] 
kk

roykhoury [11:05 AM] 
But this works fine too!

[11:06]  
I'll upload the changes on my branch if you want

[11:06]  
Oh yeah

[11:06]  
U can clone from my branch

[11:06]  
For the new new

[11:06]  
If u want

adamrais [11:07 AM] 
Roy, btw I clone the c9 project on your branch like the video, is that good ? Or I should clone it from the master

roykhoury [11:08 AM] 
It's good from my branch yeah

[11:08]  
Give me like 3 minutee

[11:09]  
I'll upload the new stuff on my branch right away

[11:09]  
Then u can clone it from there

adamrais [11:09 AM] 
Perfect, btw at what time we are meeting tomorrow?

roykhoury [11:11 AM] 
Umm not sure

[11:11]  
What time do you guys wanna meet at?

[11:11]  
12?

dana.alexandra [11:12 AM] 
12 works fr me

ryan [11:13 AM] 
i can meet for 12. i might need some help on how to use git.. i tried pulling updates in my first workspace and had some errors. i just made a new one cloning master and git status  gives

[11:13]  
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

adamrais [11:14 AM] 
Same for me, I need help with git and c9

roykhoury [11:15 AM] 
Hmm  usually that error means

[11:15]  
U didn't do git unit

[11:15]  
Git init **

[11:15]  
Try that out

[11:15]  
And also Ryan my branch is up to date!

[11:15]  
Clone it from there now and you'll get what I have at home

jng11232 [11:16 AM] 
Do u guys want to try to get a room again ?

ryan [11:17 AM] 
ok i'll try that. at what point do i run git init? after i've cloned everything and finsihed all instructions on the video?

roykhoury [11:22 AM] 
Oh wait you mean in the c9 repo??

[11:22]  
Oh that shouldn't happen

[11:22]  
Recreate a new workspace and make sure it's php/Apache

[11:22]  
And try tuning git

[11:22]  
Just "git"

[11:23]  
Orr

[11:23]  
Hmm actually I'm not sure ...

[11:23]  
I'll have to take a look

[11:23]  
But git init would be the first thing you would do technically

ryan [11:23 AM] 
before cloning the project yes?

[11:24]  
i'll try again

roykhoury [11:25 AM] 
Yeah

[11:25]  
Wait you got that error while cloning?

ryan [11:26 AM] 
After cloning then running git staus

roykhoury [11:27 AM] 
Hmm well

[11:27]  
To be honest that could be noting

[11:28]  
I don't really suggest git interactions directly from c9 anyways because the file structure is different

[11:28]  
What I do is I download the files on my computer in a certain folder with the right file structure

[11:28]  
And then git push from there locally

[11:29]  
I can show you tomorrow

ryan [11:31 AM] 
aight but i'll try cloning your latest branch and making some progress for now..

mnhn329 [3:25 PM] 
im free tmr as well, so ill see you guys then

roykhoury [6:32 PM] 
Yeah that's good!

[6:33]  
Are you guys okay with 2pm instead of? Or is that too late of a meeting?

[6:33]  
Instead of 11*

[6:33]

ryan [7:19 PM]

jng11232 [7:28 PM]

So guys, 
For travis I think ill put this here there's a few files that need to be modified and i think you need to have it in each of ur branches before pull requesting so that it goes green

[12:41]  
the files are 
.travis.yml  
Code Content/config/database.php
Code Content/phpunit.xml
Code Content/.env.travis

[12:42]  
you can copy the .travsil.yml and the .env.travis files completely they're created ffrom scratch

[12:43]  
database.php you just need to add the section with ''testing''

[12:43]  
until the closing square bracket  ],

[12:43]  
and lastly the phpunit.xml file you just add 1 line towards the end 
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="testing"/>

[12:43]  
and voila

[12:46]  
You can check out the files in the master branch and copy their content
