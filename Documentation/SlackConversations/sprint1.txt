Notes on today's meeting


----- February 4th -----
roykhoury [3:06 PM] 
Hey guys just a reminder don't forget to make a branch on github


----- February 5th -----
chenjie [8:14 PM] 
i made some directories to clean up our github page. Just need people to approve the pull request.

[8:14]  
you can take a look

roykhoury [8:20 PM] 
Umm the TA wanted us to put all sorts of documentations in one folder and the readme file was supposed to be the vision.txt basically I already did a reorganization of the folders on my branch check it out! I actually uploaded a working basic template of a Laravel/bootstrap website

siamaksamie [8:35 PM] 
working but with steps to run

[8:36]  
1) download xampp
2) in command promt go to directory with laravel files
3) type "php artisan serve"
4) you can then see it on http://localhost:8000/

roykhoury [8:38 PM] 
Well you need to install Laravel first but yeah

siamaksamie [8:39 PM] 
well your file already has alravel in it

[8:39]  
laravel*

roykhoury [8:40 PM] 
Oh true true whoops u gotta change to that directory then


----- February 6th -----
siamaksamie [10:49 PM] 
i think 3 people still didnt accept my invitations to the slack

dana.alexandra [10:53 PM] 
where do u check it lol

siamaksamie [10:54 PM] 
it was sent to everyone's email

dana.alexandra [10:55 PM] 
Just checked didnt get anything

[10:55]  
But someone said u have to commit something to become a contributor?

[10:56]  
Idk if i did it wrong, but i changed the Contributions file

[10:56]  
And made a pull request ?

[10:56]  
anyway if we are meeting wednesday, maybe someone can show me ._.

siamaksamie [10:56 PM] 
yeah i saw that

[10:56]  
sure if anything ill send the invite link again

dana.alexandra [10:57 PM] 
okehh

siamaksamie [11:00 PM] 
also who is Scabandari?

[11:03]  
I made a pull request editing something on Roy's branch. I left it as a pull request so two people can comment on it first  before merging. That's the best way for everyone to show contributions. Don't merge things unless there are two comments approving the request

siamaksamie [11:10 PM] 
speaking of...

[11:10]  
please go and comment on roy's pull request

[11:13]  
Dana also made pull request updating the "contributions" file (although in the future i think that file and the "slack conversation" should be only updated right before the meeting)

dana.alexandra [11:21 PM] 
Oooops okayy

chenjie [3:35 PM] 
if u want to add collaborators, u need to invite them individually

siamaksamie [3:48 PM] 
Ah I thought you can request to join

[3:49]  
Alright guys, can everyone who isn't already a collaborator give me your github

chenjie [3:56 PM]

mnhn329 [5:10 PM] 
mnhn329

ryan [5:12 PM] 
Scabandari

siamaksamie [11:04 PM] 
Alright, I should have added you all as collaborators. Let me know if you didn't get an invitation

siamaksamie [11:15 PM] 
Also, i misread the requirements for sprint 1 and sent the TA our user stories instead of our vision;

"REMINDER: Please email(or message on moodle) your vision before the
submission of your user stories. By Tuesday night preferably. 1 message/team."

We covered a lot in our meeting but we did not write a structured vision. I wasn't there last week, did he mention how he would like that formatted? We should do that ASAP.

siamaksamie [11:21 PM] 
If anyone wants to take the lead, I uploaded the contents of our first meeting on GitHub labelled Meeting1.txt

dana.alexandra [11:27 PM] 
By vision, did he mean our project?

[11:31]  
After our first meeting, he told us to fix our notes on that meeting and send it to him... that would include a detailed description of what we're planning to do

[11:31]  
And i think Ryan already fixed those notes

siamaksamie [11:46 PM] 
we've created a much more deatailed description before writing the user stories

dana.alexandra [11:47 PM] 
Yeah would that be the vision?

siamaksamie [11:53 PM] 
It's not well formatted. It's more like an overview of our discussion of features.

[11:54]  
Also i have a question, the vision was due tuesday but we have to submit our work tomorrow morning.

[11:54]  
is "our work" the github?

[11:55]  
Seriously, i wasn't there last week so I'm not too sure what he expects in the vision and what work we need to send in tomorrow.

roykhoury [11:57 PM] 
The TA didn't really say anything about that, he only sent in the file without saying anything


----- Yesterday February 2nd, 2017 -----
[12:02]  
I think we're going to upload a contributions.txt on github and everyone can just like add to it when they do something

[12:02]  
Since the TA wants us to keep track of everyone's contributions

dana.alexandra [12:17 AM] 
Dont we just have to send him 6-7 user stories for tomorrow?

[12:17]  
Btw this convo too should be on github ryt

siamaksamie [12:34 AM]

chenjie [7:33 PM] 
Hello, sorry for missing the meeting wednesday

[7:34]  
I went to the career fair and it took longer than expected

[7:35]  
Anyways, I worked on how our website would look like and I'd like some feedback

siamaksamie [7:40 PM] 
Cool cool show us tomorrow

[7:41]  
Or upload now but I think everyone is studying for the quiz haha

chenjie [7:42 PM] 
lol true

[7:44]  
I'm also thinking of writing a script that updates the github slack conversation file every day, but I cant guarantee anything

siamaksamie [7:46 PM] 
That actually sounds cool

roykhoury [8:03 PM] 
Cool cool

[8:03]  
We laid out a little template of our homepage

[8:03]  
In the document


----- Today February 3rd, 2017 -----
siamaksamie [9:35 AM] 
Hey guys, for the specs, I think we should go this route

[9:35]  
Front end

HTML: used to place elements on webpage

CSS: used to style HTML elements

Bootstrap: a CSS library to allow quick, responsive styling.

AngularJs: a JavaScript library to program dynamic elements on screen and to send requests to the backend.

Back end

Laravel: a PHP framework

MySQL: database management system where we will store our site and user's information

roykhoury [9:36 AM] 
Yeah that sounds good man, angularJS and Laravel :+1::+1:  I approve

roykhoury [10:32 AM] 
Btw guys meet us at H854 if you're free right now
