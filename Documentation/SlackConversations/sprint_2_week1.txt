- Show pull request!

- Have all members as contributors
- Make a documentation folder
- Add commit messages with every commit
- Task breakdown
- Review grading scheme!
- User stories which map to vision? (ex: modular quiz) 
- User story within user story, "a bit more macro"
- User story "...on any platform": too big, don't do it. Just make a website
- User story #3: break it down, too big 
- User story #2: use this as a guideline 
- Refine user stories!
- Should be able to guide TA through our documents, he shouldn't have to browse
- Send TA email to go through progress a day before and receive feedback on next meeting

roykhoury [8:20 PM] 
Umm the TA wanted us to put all sorts of documentations in one folder and the readme file was supposed to be the vision.txt basically I already did a reorganization of the folders on my branch check it out! I actually uploaded a working basic template of a Laravel/bootstrap website

siamaksamie [8:35 PM] 
working but with steps to run

[8:36]  
1) download xampp
2) in command promt go to directory with laravel files
3) type "php artisan serve"
4) you can then see it on http://localhost:8000/

roykhoury [8:38 PM] 
Well you need to install Laravel first but yeah

siamaksamie [8:39 PM]

dana.alexandra [10:57 PM]

siamaksamie [11:00 PM]

[11:03]  
I made a pull request editing something on Roy's branch. I left it as a pull request so two people can comment on it first  before merging. That's the best way for everyone to show contributions. Don't merge things unless there are two comments approving the request

siamaksamie [11:10 PM] 
speaking of...

[11:10]  
please go and comment on roy's pull request

[11:13]  
Dana also made pull request updating the "contributions" file (although in the future i think that file and the "slack conversation" should be only updated right before the meeting)

dana.alexandra [11:21 PM]
