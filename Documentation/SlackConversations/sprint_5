roykhoury [1:21 PM] 
Oh sorry guys I didn't get a notification for this chat

[1:22] 
Yeah I'm going to school right now

[1:22] 
Everyone needs to make a pull request today btw

[1:22] 
If not everyone almost everyone if you need some code to put I have some stuff for u

[1:22] 
I need to make sure the website still works after merging everything

dana.alexandra [1:24 PM] 
@siamak -- sorry didnt see this

[1:24] 
@siamaksamie  ^^^

[1:27] 
In your commit message, write "Refines User Story #4"

[1:27] 
@siamaksamie

[1:28] 
Dnt forget to add reviewers

ryan [1:30 PM] 
I don't think i need pull request cuz i uploaded a bunch of Acceptance tests. For all the US that we've finished so far i performed the tests as well.  Turns out they don't need to be finished until next sprint but it's good that we're ahead of the game there and the TA said he was still going to go through and test a bit

[1:32] 
One of our tests failed and not sure what to do. It's for a US that's been closed so we reopen it and add a task to fix???

[1:32] 
if no one knows we can ask him tmrw

dana.alexandra [1:36 PM] 
Once a user story is closed, we dnt need to re open it. Just write a subtask in the comment section of the user story

ryan [1:37 PM] 
kk

roykhoury [1:46 PM] 
Cool sounds good which US? Failed?

[1:46] 
But for everyone else who can make a pull request please do

ryan [1:48 PM] 
i'm trying to find it now but it was the one about updating profile info password , didn't work.

roykhoury [1:49 PM] 
Oh that one! Okay yeah

roykhoury [1:59 PM] 
Any1 at a lab room?

ryan [2:00 PM] 
@dana.alexandra in that subtask comment i must need to put something to mark it so that someone can reference the comment during a commit later. For example it's user story #8 and i see no other subtasks assigned to it so in the comment  i will   write

[2:00] 
#8.1 This user story failed it's acceptance test because the password could not be updated

[2:00] 
is that a kosher format?

dana.alexandra [3:56 PM] 
i dont know what kosher format is.....

[3:57] 
@mnhn329 kosher format? Know what it is?

mnhn329 [4:52 PM] 
no idea...

roykhoury [5:06 PM] 
Jojo u need to make a pull request

jng11232 [5:06 PM] 
i thought of making it with the burndown chart

[5:07] 
since idk how many more US have been closed

roykhoury [5:12 PM] 
Ok sure make sure it's tonight tho!

jng11232 [5:12 PM] 
i will!

roykhoury [5:12 PM] 
Did you finish the profile page changes ?

dana.alexandra [5:12 PM] 
Jojo we added new User stories

[5:13] 
So gotta change the points

jng11232 [5:13 PM] 
it wasnt able to cause i dont know how to make the button show only when its the user itself like till now it will only show if someone’s login in

[5:13] 
okk

dana.alexandra [5:13 PM] 
If youre busy w edit oage

[5:13] 
I can do burndown

roykhoury [5:13 PM] 
Okok u st school? It's really small

jng11232 [5:14 PM] 
and the forget the password can only be accessed when you arent logged it

[5:14] 
noo …..

roykhoury [5:14 PM] 
Come toh811

jng11232 [5:14 PM] 
unless i go to school now

roykhoury [5:14 PM] 
Ahh nah whatever haha

[5:14] 
If the acceptance test is not due tmr we can fix it another time

jng11232 [5:14 PM] 
ok

[5:16] 
@dana.alexandra what are the new US? i dont see them

dana.alexandra [5:16 PM] 
just check the project tab

[5:16] 
The one with the highest reference numbers

[5:17] 
Sorry im driving i can check later

jng11232 [5:18 PM] 
okkk

[5:18] 
if its #96 and #97, i alrdy have them

roykhoury [5:23 PM] 
Oh jojo can you review and merge my pull request on git please

[5:23] 
I can't upload stuff until it's done :disappointed:

jng11232 [5:24 PM] 
done !

roykhoury [5:26 PM] 
Thanjs!

mnhn329 [5:44 PM] 
we didnt add any others,so ya she was referring to 96 and 97

chenjie [5:54 PM] 
Yo ryan we need to prepare the email for the TA

[5:55] 
Dana or max also come to explain the changes in github

roykhoury [6:32 PM] 
Btw @ryan for the user story about contacting the administrator is it done? Cuz if it is u actually need to make a PR and reference it so we can close it

[6:34] 
Btw @dana.alexandra the key words that we came up with are good! But I think the last commit actually has to be with the original ones cuz if we close an issue manually he's gonna be like wtf guys issues should be closed with pull requests

[6:34] 
So we can use the replacement key words until the last commit we use "fixes" or whatever to actually close all our US for the sprint

ryan [6:43 PM] 
As a user, I want to be able to contact the administrators to resolve complications. #97

[6:44] 
this should have been closed last week. i did a pull request friday before we saw the TA. not sure why it's still open

[6:46] 
does that mean i didn't i didn't ref it properly cuz it didn't close automatically?

dana.alexandra [6:47 PM] 
If youre working on a subtask that will complete the user story, then just use "Closes User Story: #"

[6:48] 
And that will close the user story automatically

[6:48] 
okkk ill upload a document

[6:48] 
So u guys know how to reference ur commits for all situations ok?

ryan [6:49 PM] 
yes please

dana.alexandra [6:49 PM] 
Alsoo, i started a contributions doc

[6:49] 
So if u guys can just write what u did

[6:49] 
Then we can show all these things to TA

ryan [6:50 PM] 
added and commented on this Plain Text snippet: Show the TA for sprint 4
the usual:
-burndown chart updated
-slack chat updated 
-contributions updated
-Travis is still working

we need stuff to say for 1,2,3

ryan [6:50 PM] 
i'm at home but i just need those 3 things and i can send the email

dana.alexandra [6:54 PM] 
camelCase or under_score thing

[6:54] 
What did u guys use ??

ryan [6:55 PM] 
We just need some naming convention themes so we can say we're consistent

dana.alexandra [7:09 PM] 
added this Plain Text snippet: REFERENCING CONVENTION
REFERENCING CONVENTION
- To reference specific TASKS:
  > bug: "Corrects Task: #5.1"
  > improvement: "Refines Task: #5.1"
Add Comment Click to expand inline 24 lines

dana.alexandra [7:09 PM] 
guys have a look pls!

[7:10] 
i'll upload this on git under documentation

chenjie [7:19 PM] 
The thing is we used different conventions for like php, angular, html, but they are all consistent with each other

dana.alexandra [7:19 PM] 
uhm, maybe u can write which conventions u used for each language ?

[7:20] 
and then we can ask if he wants a universal convention or if we can keep it that way

ryan [7:21 PM] 
Within each language is fine we just need a word on each

chenjie [7:25 PM] 
Also, do we do a pull request on the convention fix?

[7:26] 
We could subtly change it while committing something else lol

ryan [7:45 PM] 
yeah not sure how to deal w/ that cuz it doesn't fit into a user story

ryan [7:54 PM] 
so for US #97 about contact us, I commented and closed it and referenced the correct pull request that should have closed it last week

chenjie [8:30 PM] 
Whered u guys go?

dana.alexandra [8:31 PM] 
Looks good ryan just saw the reference!! U can just write "Closes User Story: #" completion/bug/improvement are just to describe which term to use for u guys

jng11232 [9:35 PM] 
is there any more user stories to be closed?

ryan [10:12 PM] 
i don't think so

[10:12] 
slack convo has been updated

dana.alexandra [11:51 PM]

----- March 29th -----
chenjie [11:42 AM] 
Yea so for the edit quiz, i needed more than just the number of questions from the database

[11:42] 
I need the array of questions itself, so i can append the new questions to it and send the new array of questions

roykhoury [11:49 AM] 
Yeh we did that right?

[11:50] 
We just printed the length of the result but u can change that if you want the actual questions

chenjie [11:56 AM] 
Oh ok im omw to school, can u show me pls

roykhoury [11:56 AM] 
I'm still home for now :joy: are we meeting today?

Add Comment

roykhoury [3:12 PM] 
Yeah that seems like an old database problem

[3:12] 
Try it out

[3:12] 
Php artisan migrate:refresh

[3:12] 
And if that doesn't work u have to go to phpmyadmin delete from the migrations table

ryan [3:16 PM] 
delete the entire migration table or just its contents? not sure how to get rid of the table but i can select all and delete the contents

roykhoury [3:17 PM] 
What was the error u got when u tried doing the refresh command?

[3:17] 
U just have to delete the error name of the  table inside ur migration table

ryan [3:17 PM] 
uploaded this image: Selection_008.png
Add Comment

roykhoury [3:17 PM] 
Courses

[3:17] 
Delete courses from migrations table

[3:17] 
And it should work

ryan [3:20 PM] 
yup. tnx

roykhoury [3:20 PM] 
And then php artisan db:seed

[3:21] 
If u want the rest unis / quizzes

[3:21] 
Test*

chenjie [12:28 PM] 
I kinda need help accessing the values of the objects

roykhoury [2:23 PM] 
I'm like home still trying to fix all these bugs

[2:23] 
Maybe I can help like from home?

chenjie [2:25 PM] 
Ok ill see

jng11232 [6:52 PM] 
do u guys have any story to be close?

roykhoury [7:41 PM] 
I don't think so

dana.alexandra [7:41 PM] 
So....jojo, max, and i wont be able to finish unit testing for friday........

[7:41] 
Well tomorrow

roykhoury [7:43 PM] 
Umm well I think it's fine cuz he won't grade us tmr right?

[7:43] 
Do u have like 1 or two to show him we started?

dana.alexandra [7:43 PM] 
lol i have one.....

[7:43] 
But it failed

chenjie [7:59 PM] 
Lol not to stress u guys, but we might not have time to learn unit testing while finishing the project

dana.alexandra [8:21 PM] 
no we know. just letting u guys know we wont be done for tomorrow. But we'll obv try for sprint 5

chenjie [8:25 PM] 
U guys still at school?

jng11232 [8:25 PM] 
Yeah 815

chenjie [8:25 PM] 
Roy im almost done with the adding questions in the edit quiz

roykhoury [8:26 PM] 
Sick!

[8:26] 
U need any help?

[8:26] 
I'm home I'm almost done fixing the bugs

[8:26] 
I did a lot of small things

chenjie [8:26 PM] 
One problem im having is using ng-bind to get a variable from the controller

roykhoury [8:26 PM] 
We have 0 commits tho on git

[8:26] 
Yeah?

[8:27] 
U need help?

chenjie [8:27 PM] 
Yea idk if u know

[8:27] 
Cause i cant use $index

roykhoury [8:28 PM] 
Hmm why can't u use index? Can't u just have always an offset? Like

[8:28] 
Say there's already 3 questions

[8:28] 
U just do index + 3?

[8:28] 
Would that work or nah?

chenjie [8:29 PM] 
Lol nah cause i dont know how many questions i start with

[8:30] 
Basically, i want to put the length of the existing questions to the html

roykhoury [8:30 PM] 
But u do tho

[8:31] 
The length of existing questions? As in like how many questions is there?

chenjie [8:31 PM] 
Yea i got it inside angular, but idk the syntax to call it on html

[8:31] 
For example inside ng-bind

roykhoury [8:31 PM] 
Ahhhh

[8:31] 
Ahhhh

[8:31] 
It's literally the name

[8:32] 
No brackets no nothing

chenjie [8:32 PM] 
Oh lol

roykhoury [8:32 PM] 
<span Ng-bing="var_name" > </span>

[8:32] 
If u use $scope which I'm pretty sure u do

chenjie [8:35 PM] 
Hmm is it possible since the variable is set inside the response, its not saved?

roykhoury [8:35 PM] 
Oh I actually did it and it works

[8:35] 
Like just today

[8:35] 
Just try it out tho

chenjie [8:36 PM] 
Yea i did

[8:36] 
Doesnt work

roykhoury [8:37 PM] 
What I did is

[8:38] 
I used it in an Ng-repeat where I have a variable empty I push values to it during the http request and then in my HTML I have an Ng-repeat for that same variable and it actually has content

[8:38] 
After I run the function and not before

[8:38] 
Lemme see ur code I'll go on ur c9

chenjie [8:39 PM] 
Ok so the addquestion on html is at line 89

[8:40] 
I console.log the number of questions and gives right number

roykhoury [8:40 PM] 
Oh then it already workks

[8:40] 
It's becusse

[8:41] 
Ur editedQuestins collection has

[8:41] 
More stuff in it

[8:41] 
Ure just calling it wrong

[8:41] 
U have to use id

[8:41] 
So question.id

[8:41] 
Instead of just question

chenjie [8:42 PM] 
which line?

roykhoury [8:43 PM] 
Wait give me access to ur c9

[8:46] 
I sent u a msg on c9

chenjie [8:46 PM] 
Jojo did u guys move?

roykhoury [8:48 PM] 
Ok yeah yo

[8:48] 
I think for this page it's easier to just do the whole thing with Angular

[8:48] 
And just remove the blade for each

[8:48] 
But actually wait nvm I didn't say anything

roykhoury [8:53 PM] 
Yeah check c9

chenjie [8:57 PM] 
yea mb

[9:01] 
wait what did u change lol

roykhoury [9:02 PM] 
I sent u messages on the side there

[9:02] 
Idk if u can see lOL idk there was a chat box

[9:02] 
But basically it's working

[9:02] 
But the problem is

[9:03] 
The data we get from the db gets refreshed every time because the + button actually re fetches the data and since that button doesn't really change anything in the db we can never increase the number of questions likes it's always the same

[9:03] 
We need to put that http request outside of the function

[9:03] 
Cuz we have to only call it once

[9:03] 
Not every time u click the button right?

chenjie [9:04 PM] 
oh i see

roykhoury [9:05 PM] 
Yeah my bad I wasn't thinking when I did it

chenjie [9:06 PM] 
but why did u remove my ng-repeat?

[9:06] 
nvm

roykhoury [9:06 PM] 
I didn't

[9:06] 
LOL

[9:06] 
All I did was change the

[9:06] 
Nun of questions + 1

[9:06] 
To question.id

[9:06] 
To see if it was working but

[9:07] 
It never incrémented all of them were 1 because every time u click it restarts from 0

[9:07] 
So yeaaabh

chenjie [9:07 PM] 
ok yea

[9:08] 
so can i just move the http request outside of the function, but still in the controller?

[9:08] 
that way when the controller is called, it requests only once/

[9:08] 
?

roykhoury [9:08 PM] 
Yeah that's what we want

chenjie [9:08 PM] 
ok cool

roykhoury [9:08 PM] 
But u might have to do some changes

[9:08] 
I'm not sure yet but that's the way to go

chenjie [9:09 PM] 
yea ill do that

roykhoury [9:09 PM] 
So u can try stuff

[9:09] 
Cool :+1:

chenjie [9:17 PM] 
ok idk if there is a quick to fix, but since i dont pass the quiz_id to the function as an event

[9:17] 
how can i pass the quiz_id from php directly to angular?

roykhoury [9:18 PM] 
Hmm yeah u kind of have to pass it from blade to an input field or a div or something which has an Ng-model that's kind of the way to do it and then the Ng-model will give u the value of that input field which is indirectly from blade

chenjie [9:19 PM] 
ok ill try something

roykhoury [9:19 PM] 
Yeah

[9:19] 
Yeah

[9:20] 
If u want take a look at my uhh home.blade.php and the search-form controller

[9:20] 
I've played with it a bit

[9:20] 
It might help

chenjie [9:20 PM] 
cool ill take a look

chenjie [9:40 PM] 
im a genius

[9:40] 
on the controller, ng-init  = initQuizID(questions->quiz_id)

roykhoury [9:44 PM] 
Oh perfect LOL


----- March 31st -----

Add Comment

chenjie [2:01 PM] 
Yo ryan can u message the ta to postpone the meeting for next week?

ryan [2:02 PM] 
so in the grading scheme for done enough work there's points for completing new user stories so i'm wondering can this be a new feature/user story??

roykhoury [2:02 PM] 
Haha cool and nah it's just like something the TA wants

[2:02] 
Like more fluidity

[2:02] 
Idk if it counts because

[2:02] 
It redirects u to the last page after creating the quiz

[2:03] 
Where u have  green correct answer and the normal answers

ryan [2:04 PM] 
but viewing past quizzes w/out taking them or editing them is a feature that's not mentioned in other user stories no?

[2:04] 
as a user i want to be able to view any past quizzes that i've created???

[2:04] 
something like that?

roykhoury [2:04 PM] 
Hmm I guess we can make one

[2:04] 
It's a new one yeah it didn't exist before

ryan [2:08 PM] 
uhhh yeah i can msg the TA.

[2:08] 
You need to email your TA to negotiate a meeting time. The deadline for your sprint is set to the time before your meeting.
However, this meeting must happen before 5PM Thursday April 13th, since the school closes on April 14 and April 17.

[2:09] 
not sure what this means: The deadline for your sprint is set to the time before your meeting.

[2:09] 
not earlier than friday?

roykhoury [2:10 PM] 
I'm not sure actually but, I guess we just have to message him about the extension before Friday so today would for sure be good

ryan [2:12 PM] 
we also have to come up w/ a day next week we can all meet and next friday same time doesn't work cuz that's the 14th

roykhoury [2:12 PM] 
I think the team was thinking April 13 haha

ryan [2:12 PM] 
works for me!

jng11232 [2:13 PM] 
Yeaaah

ryan [2:13 PM] 
everyone sign off on that so i can msg right away. we don't want to be last in line. Any time thursday is good?

roykhoury [2:14 PM] 
After 11:30 for me

jng11232 [2:14 PM] 
Anytime for me

ryan [2:19 PM] 
@dana.alexandra @adamrais @mnhn329 @siamaksamie @chenjie  need an ok from you guys on Thurday the 13th after 11:30

chenjie [2:22 PM]

dana.alexandra [2:50 PM]

ryan [3:27 PM] 
ok already we don't have a very big window for the TA. I can ask for that time slot but do you guys have stuff you absolutely can't miss if it's not available cuz if i don't give him options then we could play email tag until friday

chenjie [3:36 PM] 
11h30-1h15, 2h30-4h15

ryan [3:36 PM]

roykhoury [3:37 PM]

ryan [11:48 PM] 
oh but wait. maybe i spoke too soon. I just cloned the whole project but didn't do any phpmy admin stuff so maybe that could have something to do with it. i'll find out

ryan [11:55 PM] 
Yean i can login and register, make courses and everything so i don't think it's a phpmyadmin prob.

[11:55] 
Seems like a small fix but it's also stopping me from passing the last acceptance test. #20 about logging in, keeping track o community interactions, part of that is seeing your quiz history. i just need to know that a quiz recently taken shows up in your profile but with that button not working i cannot verify
